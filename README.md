Bluetooth Low Energy app that reads impedance values from an AD5933: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOqD4fKjAXw

I'm still in the process of rewriting this project to use RxJava and fixing miscellaneous bugs. Repository is updated in my free time.

This app communicates with an AD5933 with an analog front end to measure the impedance of objects. It can instruct the AD5933 to pefrom frequency sweeps over it's intended frequency range (1 - 100 KHZ) as well as vary it's sample rate.

The overview of the project can be seen in the video linked in the title.
